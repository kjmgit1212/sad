  <h2><a name="Overview%20and%20Clarification"></a>Overview and Clarification</h2>
  The Self-Registration example demonstrates to IBM Security Identity Manager  
  administrators  how to use the SelfRegistrationManager 
  API.
  <br><br>
  
	
  The self-registration of identities is an important aspect of identity management. 
  However, administrators might provide this capability 
  using different methods. The differences might occur in  field validation 
  or in the authentication process. (For  this example, if an 
  end user can view the <a href="sr/selfReg.jsp">selfReg.jsp</a>, 
   validation has occurred.)  Because of these differences, the process to handle self-registering 
  identities is highly customizable.
<br>
<br>The Security 
  Identity Manager administrator must create the user interface for self-registration.  
  The <a href="sr/selfReg.jsp">selfReg.jsp</a> provides an example to 
  the administrator about integrating a customized user interface with specific field 
  presentation and validation requirements with Security Identity Manager.
  <br><br>
	
	
  As part of the self-registration process, the administrator can customize the authentication of identities and associated attributes before they are entered into the identity repository. Because  self-registration enables unknown users to define themselves 
  to the system, the administrator must validate any access-enabling information (Access-enabling information is information that might provide access to resources.) To validate this information the administrator  defines a workflow process that is triggered 
  after the user submits the information.  This mechanism, &quot;selfRegister&quot;, is available to the administrator as one of the ready-to-use operations provided for identity entities.
  <br><br>
  
	 
  In this example, the only required fields  are the  last name, full name, and 
  location of the user. Required fields are denoted by the asterisk (*) symbol on the <a href="sr/selfReg.jsp">selfReg.jsp</a> page.
  <br><br>  

	 
  For  this example, the  administrator must create a Location in 
  Security Identity Manager.  This Location is where the newly self-registered user is placed after 
  registration.
  <br><br>
  
	 
  If a Location is not appropriate for placement of the self-registered user, 
  the administrator can update the <a href="sr/selfReg.jsp">selfReg.jsp</a>
  file to specify a different type of business unit (For example, a business unit might be Organizational Unit, Admin Domain, and so on.)
  If a different type of business unit is necessary,
  the <a href="src/examples/selfregistration/ValidateData.java">ValidateData.java</a> 
  file and the "selfRegister" operation (system defined entity type) must be updated.
  <br><br>
  
			 
  The valid attributes of the <a href="sr/selfReg.jsp">selfReg.jsp</a> file are based on the 
  inetOrgPerson objectClass of LDAP.  An administrator of Security Identity Manager and 
  self-registration can change the <a href="sr/selfReg.jsp">selfReg.jsp</a> file to request or require 
  more or fewer attributes based on the inetOrgPerson objectClass.
  <br>

  <h2><a name="Configuration"></a>Configuration</h2>
  Before compiling and building the self-registration example, configure the example for your environment.<ul>
    <li>
      Edit the <a href="sr/WEB-INF/classes/context.properties">context.properties</a> file.
	</li>
	<li>To use the self-registration example in an environment
	language other than English, install the self-registration example on
	the WebSphere application server running Security Identity Manager. </li>
	<li>If you plan to install the self-registration example on a
	WebSphere application server that is not running Security Identity
	Manager, change the line that reads <br>
	<samp>
	<var><b>appServerURL</b></var>=iiop://localhost</i> to <br>
	<var>appServerURL</var>=iiop://<var>hostname</var>.
	</samp><br>
	The <var>hostname</var> is the host name of WebSphere application server on
	which Security Identity Manager is running. <br> <b>Note</b> : For cluster environment , this should be same as <samp><var>value of <b>enrole.appServer.url property</b></var>, defined in {ITIM_HOME}/data/enRole.properties  . This should be taken from any one of the cluster node .</samp></li><li><samp>
				
			</samp>
		
      Set the <b><i>principal</i></b> property to the name of the user who is assigned
      as the ITIM_CLIENT or ITIM_SYSTEM role. Typically this value is the same
      as the value of the enrole.appServer.ejbuser.principal or enrole.appServer.clientUser.principal property in
      the enRole.properties file. The enRole.properties file is located in the
      <VAR>$ITIM_HOME</VAR>/data/ directory. The  <VAR>$ITIM_HOME</VAR> directory is the directory where Security
	Identity Manager is installed.</li>
	<li>
      Set the <b><i>credential</i></b> property to the password of the user specified in the
      principal property. Typically this value is the same as the value of the
      enrole.appServer.ejbuser.credentials or enrole.appServer.clientUser.credentials property in the enRole.properties
      file. Note: If you have used the
      Security Identity Manager runConfig command to encrypt the value of the
      enrole.appServer.ejbuser.credentials property, you must specify the unencrypted password as the value for the credential property.

	<li>Set the <b><i>realm</i></b> property to the name of the realm where  the principal resides. Typically this value is the same as the value of
	the enrole.appServer.realm  property in the
	enRole.properties file. </li>
	</li>
    <li>
      Save your changes to <a href="sr/WEB-INF/classes/context.properties">context.properties</a>.
    </li>
  </ul> 
  <br>

  <h2><a name="CompileBuild"></a>Compile and Build</h2>
  Use the build scripts in the examples directory to compile 
  the <a href="src/examples/selfregistration/ValidateData.java">ValidateData.java</a> file and create
  the sr.war in the
  <var>$ITIM_HOME</var>/extensions/<var>RELEASE_VERSION</var>/examples/selfregistration
  directory. The <VAR>$ITIM_HOME</VAR> directory is the directory where Security Identity Manager is
  installed. The
<VAR>RELEASE_VERSION</VAR> is the version of Security Identity Manager.
See <a href="../Building.html">Building the Examples</a> for
  more details about building the examples. To build only the
  self-registration example, specify <i>selfReg</i> as the target when
  building the examples. For example, issuing the &quot;<i>build selfReg</i>&quot; command
  on Windows operating systems, or the &quot;<i>./build.sh selfReg</i>&quot; command on UNIX operating systems,
   compiles the ValidateData.java and creates sr.war file. The administrator installs this war file  onto WebSphere application server by using the following <a href="#WASInstall">instructions</a>. If the administrator changes the
  content of the <a href="src/examples/selfregistration/ValidateData.java">ValidateData.java</a> file,
  the administrator must build the self-registration example again.<br><br>


	<h2><a name="WASInstall"></a>Installation on WebSphere</h2>You can install the self-registration example  in the WebSphere
  environment either:
<ul>
	<li>
	 
	On a WebSphere application server that is running Security Identity Manager</li>
	<li>On a WebSphere application server that is not running Security Identity Manager (This installation requires updating the <a
		href="sr/WEB-INF/classes/context.properties">context.properties</a>
  file associated with the self-registration example. See <a href="#Configuration">Configuration</a>.) 
  </li>
  </ul>
  If you plan to use this example in an environment language other than English, install the self-registration example on the WebSphere application
  server running Security Identity Manager.
	<br>
	<br>


	To install the self-registration example on WebSphere, follow these steps:
  <ol>
    <li>
      If you are installing the self-registration example on a WebSphere
      application server that is not running Security Identity Manager, copy the sr.war file
      from the <VAR>$ITIM_HOME</VAR>/extensions/<VAR>RELEASE_VERSION</VAR>/examples/selfregistration
      directory to the system where the self-registration example is being installed. The <VAR>$ITIM_HOME</VAR> is the directory where Security Identity Manager is
      installed. The <VAR>RELEASE_VERSION</VAR> is the version of Security Identity Manager.

    The <VAR>hostname</VAR> is the host name of the WebSphere application server on which self-registration example is installed.For cluster environment , hostname will be the node hostname , for which it was configured . </li>
<P><B>Note:</B> If Java 2 security is enabled for the WebSphere
Application Server where the self-registration example is installed, follow these additional steps:</P>
  <LI>Edit the <b>was.policy</b> file in the
    <VAR>$WAS_HOME</VAR>/profiles/<VAR>$PROFILE_NAME</VAR>/config/cells/<VAR>$CELL_NAME</VAR>/applications/sr_war.ear/deployments/sr_war/META-INF directory.
    The <VAR>$WAS_HOME</VAR> directory is the directory where WebSphere
    Application Server is installed. The <VAR>$PROFILE_NAME</VAR> is the name of
    the WebSphere Application Server profile in which the self-registration
    example is installed. The <VAR>$CELL_NAME</VAR> is the name of the
    WebSphere Application Server cell in which the self-registration example
    is installed.</LI>
  <LI>Modify the application permissions in the <b>was.policy</b>
    file:<BR>
    <SAMP>grant codeBase &quot;file:${application}&quot; {<BR>
