<P>The Identity Manager provisioning platform is designed with
extensibility as a primary goal. The platform architecture has
defined several applications that perform different provisioning
specific functions, such as password management, identity management,
and account management. These applications have well defined external
interfaces that can be used by clients to trigger their
functionality. A great example of this would be the user interface
that is deployed with the Identity Manager product. These interfaces,
however, can be used by clients that would like a different entry
point into the platform, such as a more customer specific user
interface or a different application integrating its capabilities
with the platform. This document describes the Application
Programming Interface (API) that is available for interfacing to the
provisioning applications.</P>
<H2><A NAME="overview"></A>Overview</H2>
<P>The Application API has been developed to provide the developers
of custom front-ends to Identity Manager a portable and
backwards-compatible interface to the Identity Manager
applications.<BR>The API consists of a set of java classes that
abstract the more commonly used functions of the provisioning
platform, such as identity management, password management, and
account management. The classes that make up this API are the same
classes the Identity Manager product uses for its out-of-the-box user
interface. In the platform architecture, the application tier makes
use of all the lower level services to implement the end-to-end
business logic involved in a provisioning action. This may require
workflow processes to execute (see the Workflow API), the data store
to be updated (see the Data Services API), or resources to be
provisioned (see the Service Provider API). These implementation
details of a provisioning action are encapsulated within the
application module to ensure to the client that the action will be
implemented correctly and that backwards compatibility with platform
upgrades will not be an issue.<BR>One aspect of the business logic
behind a provisioning action is authorizing the caller to perform the
action by using the security mechanisms put in place the
Authorization module in the platform architecture. For this reason,
all Application API calls require user information about the caller
so that the proper authorization can take place. To make calls in an
unrestricted manner, the client must act as the administrator and
pass the administrator’s information into the API calls.</P>
<H2><A NAME="apiDescription"></A>API Description</H2>
<P>The API consists of a set of java classes that abstract the more
commonly used functions of the provisioning platform, such as
identity management, password management, and account management. All
of these classes can be found in the <A HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/apps/package-summary.html">com.ibm.itim.apps
package</A> and its sub-packages.<BR>The Application API is
remoteable. This allows clients to communicate with the provisioning
platform without requiring co-location. To establish communications
with the provisioning platform, a context must be created. This
context is established using a set of classes that make up a
framework that can support connecting to different platform
deployment configurations easily without changes to the client. The
<A HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/apps/PlatformContext.html">PlatformContext</A>
class represents the context of a connection to a provisioning
platform. This class is merely an interface whose implementation may
be different based on the deployment configuration of the target
platform. The entry point for the client to establish the a platform
context is through the <A HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/apps/InitialPlatformContext.html">InitialPlatformContext</A>
class. This class will ensure the proper implementations to the
context interfaces are constructed for the client by either using the
<A HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/apps/PlatformContextFactory.html">PlatformContextFactory</A>
passed by name to it at construction time, or by looking up the
correct PlatformContextFactory class in the Identity
Manager.properties file.</P>

<P>The Application API is secure and requires
clients to authenticate to the platform. This authentication is
performed through a Java Authentication and Authorization Service
(JAAS) standard Java Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) framework
and API. This framework supports users authenticating to multiple
applications. The applications might use different authentication mechanisms.
Identity Manager has provided its own authentication mechanism based
on its own authentication framework (see the <A HREF="../authentication/authentication.html">Identity
Manager Authentication API</A> ). This mechanism is configured for
use in the client environment through a security configuration file.
The JAAS framework supports the different authentication modules
through a series of Callbacks and CallbackHandlers. Identity Manager
supports authentication through the use of standard WebSphere authentication mechanisms. The following snippet illustrates the use of JAAS to
authenticate to WebSphere and the resulting subject is used throughout Identity Manager to perform tasks.</P>
<PRE>CallbackHandler handler = new WSCallbackHandlerImpl(&quot;jdoe&quot;, &quot;secret&quot;));
LoginContext lc = new LoginContext(&quot;WSLogin&quot;, handler);
lc.login();</PRE><P>
The preceding snippet is performing a password based authentication to WebSphere.  This snippet assumes that the
standard WSLogin application is registered as a login module.</P>
<p>The Application API also supports changing and resetting  user passwords through challenge response. The API uses the ForgotPasswordManager class to perform this task.  This class takes a PlatformContext and enables the retrieval of the challenge response questions.   Before IBM Security Identity Manager 6.0, the PlatformCallbackHandler class was used to perform this task.</p>
was invoked as an argument (with the â??D option), or the
<P>
<BR>Another concept common
to many of the Application API calls is the asynchronous request.
Many of the API calls are asynchronous, or non-blocking, and may take
minutes or even hours if human interaction is required to fulfill the
request (i.e., through an approval process). The Request class
represents an asynchronous request. Many calls will return a <A HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/apps/Request.html">Request</A>
object so that the client can check the status of their submission.
The <A HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/apps/RequestManager.html">RequestManager</A>
class provides the client with a interface for querying, or locating,
requests they may not have a handle to currently. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="images/image006.gif" NAME="graphics3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=271 HEIGHT=45 BORDER=0><BR><B>Figure
2: Request Class Diagram</B></P>
<P>The classes that provide interfaces to the identity specific
capabilities of the platform can be found in the
<A HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/apps/identity/package-summary.html">com.ibm.itim.apps.identity
package</A> . The pattern followed by this API consists of a managed
object that represents an entity to manage (i.e., account, role,
person), a value object holding attribute information data about that
entity, and a manager that an aggregate of other operations within
the context of the type of managed object to manage (i.e., creating
objects, validating objects, etc.). 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="images/image008.gif" NAME="graphics4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=448 HEIGHT=45 BORDER=0><BR><B>Figure
3: Application Pattern Diagram</B></P>
<P>The use of the value object is key because all API calls are
fulfilled by the platform with the most up-to-date information
possible at the time of the call. This means the platform will query
its data store on every request. If the client wishes to simply get a
"snapshot" of the managed object’s information, only querying
the data store once for performance reasons, obtaining the value
object will best achieve the goal.
