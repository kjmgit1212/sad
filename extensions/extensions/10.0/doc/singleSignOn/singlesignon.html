<P>This document describes the configuration of single sign-on for Identity Manager.</P>
<H2><A NAME="overview"></A>Overview</H2>
<P>Some Identity Manager installations may be required to be
integrated with third party single sign-on providers. Typically, such
single sign-on providers protect a set of web-based resources using
an authentication data store that is managed separately from Identity
Manager. The first time a client attempts to access any protected
resource, the single sign-on provider will authenticate and, if
successful, will pass a token indicating the identity of the
authenticated user to all subsequently accessed resources.
</P>
<P>When using a single sign-on provider with Identity Manager it will
be necessary to add a customized logon user interface specific to the
single sign-on provider. Typically, single sign-on providers
intercept http requests to a protected resource, authenticate the
user, and place authentication data into the http header before
allowing access to the resource. In this case the protected resource
is the Identity Manager user interface.</P>
<P>The standard logon user interface provided with Identity Manager
will not be appropriate, since it will prompt the user for a user id
and password. An Identity Manager logon interface customized for a
single sign-on logon provider will typically collect user credentials
from the sign-on provider, verify that the user has a Identity
Manager account, establish an Identity Manager session, and forward
the user into the Identity Manager system.</P>
<P>Logout and session timeout are related problems that can also be
addressed to fit in with custom approaches.</P>

system configured for user with a single sign-on provider.</P>

<br>
<P>The steps when a user logs in via a single sign-on provider:</P>
<OL>
    <LI>The user attempts to access the Identity Manager
    web user interface for the first time in the current session.
	<LI>The single sign-on provider prompts the user for their user
	id and password.
	<LI>The user provides their user id and password.
	<LI>The single sign-on provider verifies the user id and
	password.
	<LI>The single sign-on provider places a token indicating that
	the user has been authenticated and a second token with the user id
	in the HTTP request header/session or as a request parameter. Schemes for doing this will be specific
	to individual providers.
	<LI>The single sign-on provider forwards the request to the
	custom logon module. This is the class written as part of the
	integration exercise.
	<LI>The SSO Adapter calls the Identity Manager authentication framework to authenticate the user.
	<LI>There is no need for the custom authentication authority to
	authenticate since the single sign-on provider already performed
	that. However, it still needs to look up the Identity Manager system
	user by their user id and, if they exist, return the SystemUser
	user id as a String to the caller. If the user does not exist then a
	<FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New">ITIMUISSOUserIdNotFoundException</FONT></FONT>
	should be thrown. Since Identity Manager uses a different data store
	than the single sign-on provider, the user id’s must be identical
	on each.Otherwise, If the user id used to the authenticate to the SSO provider does not match the
	ISDI user id, the adapter is responsible for mapping/returning the ISDI user id in getUserId() method in SSO Adapter.
	<LI>At this point control is returned to the Identity Manager Login module , which can now
	establish the Identity Manager user session.
	<LI>The Identity Manager Login module now forwards the user to the Identity
	Manager system including the main menu from which the user may
	choose any action that they are authorized to perform. </OL>
<P>A custom logon user interface appropriate to custom authentication
methods may be added to Identity Manager. There are two steps
required:</P>
<OL>
	<LI>Write Java code to define the login user interface, that collects logon credentials, and
	establishes the user’s Identity Manager session through Single Sign On.
	<LI>Register the Servlet with the application server (not required if a Java
	Server Page is used).
</OL>
<P>The Identity Manager framework requires an Identity Manager user
id at logon time in order to establish an Identity Manager session. An SSO Adapter
that examines the incoming HTTP request for logon information
placed in the header by an external authentication authority may
implement this.</P>
<P>An example for the same is , SampleSSOAdapter.java (which implements the SSOAdapter interface) provided in the examples directory.</P>
<P>To establish an Identity Manager session and forward the user to
the Identity Manager application, use the <FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New">SampleSSOAdapter.java </FONT></FONT>
class. The customer needs to provide the implementation for the following methods in the implementation class of SSOAdapter interface:</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New">isAuthenticated(HttpServletRequest request)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>This method returns true if the request object passed to this method is authenticated via an SSO provider. Otherwise,it will throw  ITIMUIException or ITIMUISSOUserIdNotFoundException.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New">getUserId(HttpServletRequest request)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>This method returns the ISDI User ID that identifies the authenticated user. The SSO adapter should use information stored in the HTTP request to identify the ISDI user.
If the user id used to the authenticate to the SSO provider does not match the ISDI user id, the adapter is responsible for mapping/returning the ISDI user id.</P>
<p>Note : The SampleSSOAdapter.java provided in the $ISDI_HOME\extensions\examples\singlesignon\src\examples\singlesignon example  is only a sample implementation provided for user's reference. It does not cater to the specific security requirements of the user.
In this example, only null check of the user id is present as an authentication mechanism. Hence while using the same for a  production  environment , kindly perform the required modifications in this class. </p>
<P>
Details of the <FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New">SSOAdapter</FONT></FONT>
interface, <FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New">ITIMUIException</FONT></FONT>,
<FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New">ITIMUISSOUserIdNotFoundException</FONT></FONT> classes
are provided in the API documents.</P>
<P>When the user logs out, their session will be terminated and by
default they will be directed back to the Identity Manager logon
page. If this is not appropriate a new logout URL should be
registered. The property enrole.ui.logoffURL in file ui.properties
should be set to the URL where the user should be directed to when
logging out of the Identity Manager application. This may be set to
the URL of a HTML page, a JSP page, a Servlet, or some other web
resource.</P>
<P>It is desirable that, on logging out, the user’s HTTP session be
terminated. This can be done by a call to <FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New">session.invalidate().</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P>If the user’s session times out then, by default, the user will
again be forwarded to the logon page. This may also be inappropriate
for a single sign-on protected installation. A separate session
timeout URL is defined for this by the parameter <FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New">enrole.ui.timeoutURL</FONT></FONT>
in the ui.properties configuration file.</P>
<H2><a name="envSetUp"></a>Environment Set-up</H2>
<P>All custom code written must be compiled and added to the
application server classpath. An appropriate place to locate the
classes is in the lib directory under $ISDI_HOME. The classes should be put into a jar file. If the classes
are placed in $ISDI_HOME/lib, then you should modify the WebSphere shared library ITIM Lib to include your jar file. Using the WAS admin console, navigate to Environment &gt; Shared Libraries and select ITIM Lib. Then add a new line to the Classpath text box that looks something like:</P>
<pre>${ITIM_HOME}/lib/your_custom_jar.jar</pre>
<p>Save the changes and restart WAS to have your custom code included in the Classpath.</p>
