<H2><A NAME="purpose"></A>Purpose of this Document</H2>
<P>The Identity Manager provisioning platform is
designed with extensibility as a primary goal. Many of the architectural components
have been built using frameworks that can make use of custom
extensions. This document describes how the shared access authorization engine can be extended 
by plugin custom authorization providers. The ability  to plugin custom
providers is provided through the use of a defined application
programming interface (API). This document describes the Shared Access Authorization API.  
It also describes how to configure the custom providers.</P>
<H2><A NAME="overview"></A>Overview</H2>
<P>Clients can use the Shared Access Authorization API to plugin one or more custom authorization providers.
When there are multiple providers configured, the shared access
authorization engine combines the results returned from all providers in the
following manner:</P><p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>Uses &quot;Union&quot; to combine the result of authorized
	shared accesses returned from multiple providers.
	<li>Uses &quot;Or&quot; to combine the boolean return of checkout
	authorization.</li>
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
</p>
<P>
<P>
<p>The Shared Access Authorization API consists of 
<ul>
<li> An interface any custom provider must implement
<li> A search filter class which defines the search attributes for the authorized shared accesses
<li> A mediator class that invokes the authorization from all providers configured 
<li> An exception class which represents an error condition during authorization
</ul>
<p>
The API classes can be found in the <a
	href="../../api/com/ibm/itim/script/package-summary.html">com.ibm.itim.pim.authority</a>,
  classes in <a
	href="../../api/com/ibm/itim/script/wrappers/package-summary.html">com.ibm.itim.dataservices.model.pim</a> and <a
	href="../../api/com/ibm/itim/script/wrappers/package-summary.html">com.ibm.itim.dataservices.model</a> are also referenced as part of the API parameters.</p>
</P><H2><A NAME="apiDescription"></A>API Description</H2>
<P>The focal class in the API is the
<a
	HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/remoteservices/provider/ServiceProvider.html">SharedAccessAuthorizationStrategy</a>.
This  interface defines two authorization methods: 
<ul>
<li> Find the authorized shared accesses for a given user with a search filter 
<li> Determine if a given user is authorized to check out a shared access
</ul>
A custom authorization provider must implement this interface.</P><P><a
	HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/remoteservices/provider/ServiceProvider.html">CredentialComponent</a> is an interface representing a credential or credential pool.  
	A authorization provider returns the authorized shared accesses as a collection of CredentialComponent. 
	The provider can either construct CredentialComponent with Credential and CredentialPool, 
	or provide its own implementation for CredentialComponent. </P>
<p><a
	HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/remoteservices/provider/ServiceProvider.html">SharedAccessSearchFilter</a> defines the search attributes for the authorized shared accesses. 
	The search attributes include a list of predefined attributes, plus a generic attribute and value map for any additional search attributes which is provided for extensibility. 
	A custom provider should filter the shared accesses with the search attribute values. <a
	HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/remoteservices/provider/ServiceProvider.html">SearchParameter</a> defines the search size limit and scope. 
	The scope is applicable only if SharedAccessSearchFilter specifies the match string for the business unit name; otherwise, the scope is ignored.</p>
<p><a
	HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/remoteservices/provider/ServiceProvider.html">SharedAccessAuthority</a> serves as a mediator in the shared access authorization engine. It calls <a
	HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/remoteservices/provider/ServiceProvider.html">SharedAccessAuthorizationProviderFactory</a> to get all the providers that are configured in pim.properties 
	and invokes the authorization method from all providers in sequence, until the maximum size limit reached or until one provider return boolean value &quot;true&quot;.
Below show an example of registering one custom authorization provider, and an example of registering one custom authorization provider together with the default authorization provider provided by Identity Manager:
<pre>
sa.authority.provider=examples.pim.SampleSAAuthrozationProvider
</pre></p><p>
<pre>sa.authority.provider=examples.pim.SampleSAAuthrozationProvider,com.ibm.itim.pim.authority.store.SharedAccessPolicyEvaluator</pre></p><p>If there are no providers configured in the properties file,
SharedAccessAuthrozationProviderFactory return the default role-based
shared access policy authorization provider, named <a
	HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/remoteservices/provider/ServiceProvider.html"></a>SharedAccessPolicyEvaluator.</p>
<p><a
	HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/remoteservices/provider/ServiceProvider.html">SharedAccessAuthorityException</a> represents an error condition during authorization. </p><H2><A NAME="apiExample"></A>API Example</H2>
<P>Please see the accompanying example code with
this package.</P>
