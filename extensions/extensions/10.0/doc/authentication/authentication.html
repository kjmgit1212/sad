<P>The Identity Manager provisioning platform is designed with
extensibility as a primary goal. Many of the architectural components
have been built using frameworks that can make use of custom
extensions. This document describes the framework used within the
Authentication component of Identity Manager and how it can be
extended. The part of the framework that will be extended by a client
will be called the Application Programming Interface (API).</P>
<a name="overview"><H2>Overview</H2></a>
<P>The authentication extensible framework and API has been developed
to satisfy two specific goals. One goal is to enable the use of
different trusted identity stores. So, for example, a customer may
want to make use of the identity information stored on a Windows NT
domain server or an LDAP directory.

<b>Figrue 1: Use of Windows NT domain server for identity store</b></P>
<P>Another goal is to enable the use of different types of keys,
typically passwords, to unlock the application to the user. For
example, the use of a SecureID token could be used instead of the
typical hashed password.</P>
<P>The java-based framework that satisfies these goals is called by
the Identity Manager provisioning platform at any time it needs to
authenticate a user. The interface used by the platform is abstracted
so that any custom extensions would be hidden, and therefore the
presence of these extensions will have no impact on the overall
design of the platform itself. 
</P>
<P> The
 type of client that will use this API is looking to extend the framework to customize the way
the authentication is performed.</P>
<a name="providerAPI"><H2>Provider API Description</H2></a>
<P>The purpose of the Provider API is to allow custom extensions to
the authentication framework. A client attempting to authenticate a
user will not use this portion of the API, but instead, a client that
wishes to override the behavior of the system when other clients
attempt to authenticate a user.</P>
<P>The authentication framework consists of the
SystemAuthenticationAuthority class 
which makes use of one or more <A HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/authentication/AuthenticationProvider.html">AuthenticationProvider</A>
classes to implement the actual authentication algorithms. The
SystemAuthenticationAuthority itself merely constructs the correct
AuthenticationProvider based on the type of credentials being used
and defers to that provider to perform the actual authentication
logic. So, to extend or customize the authentication logic to be
performed, a client would create their own AuthenticationProvider and
register it with the SystemAuthenticationAuthority.</P>
<P>The AuthenticationProvider class is a java interface. Its purpose
is to define the method signatures needed for the
SystemAuthenticationAuthority to use for authentication. The method
that is used for this is
authenticate(Credentials userCredentials). When a class implements the
AuthenticationProvider interface, it will also need to implement the logic to
be used within the authenticate method.</P>
<P>In order to make the implementation of the authentication calls
totally transparent to a client requesting authentication, the
SystemAuthenticationAuthority must be able to determine which
implementation class of the AuthenticationProvider interface to use
during a request. This is achieved through the use of factories that
can be specified to the SystemAuthenticationAuthority within the
enRoleAuthentication.properties file. The client that
creates the AuthenticationProvider implementation will also provide
an implementation of the <A HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/authentication/AuthenticationProviderFactory.html">AuthenticationProviderFactory</A>
interface. This interface will be called by the
SystemAuthenticationAuthority when it needs to create a new
AuthenticationProvider implementation. Because the details that go
into setting up the context and constructing an
AuthenticationProvider may be quite different between
implementations, the factory’s purpose is to hide those differences
and perform the construction behind a standard interface. This
interface is defined with the create method. This create method
performs its implementation specific construction and returns an
instance of an AuthenticationProvider interface.</P>
<P>The  enRoleAuthentication.properties file holds
assignments of AuthenticationProvider classes to authentication
mechanisms. Two of the mechanisms are used when a user authenticates
to the provisioning server, (user id and password) and certificate.
There is one additional mechanism, service, which is how connectors
authenticate to the provisioning platform. To assign an
AuthenticationProvider to one of these mechanisms, place the full
class name of the corresponding AuthenticationProviderFactory in the
file. See below for the default Identity
enRoleAuthentication.properties file that is installed with the
platform.</P>
