<H2><A NAME="purpose"></A>Purpose of this Document</H2>
<P>The Identity Manager provisioning platform is
designed with extensibility as a primary goal. Its primary strength
is its ability to provision many diverse types of resources and
services. To enable this strength, the ability to plug custom
connectors into the platform without altering the core platform
itself has been provided through the use of a defined application
programming interface (API). This document describes this API, named
the Provisioning Connector API, and how it interacts with the
Identity Manager provisioning platform.</P>
<H2><A NAME="overview"></A>Overview</H2>
<P>The Provisioning Connector API has been
developed to provide the developers of custom connectors that can be
used from the Identity Manager provisioning platform, or any other
java-based provisioning platform that supports the same interface. It
is expected that the provisioning platform itself will perform all of
the operations needed to determine the operations and their
parameters that are to be executed against resources. The connector
itself will be responsible for executing those operations on the
resource in whatever resource specific manner required. The interface
between the platform and the connector used to implement this
procedure is defined with this API.</P>
<P>There are eight operations that make up the
interface between the provisioning platform and the connector, add,
modify, delete, suspend, restore, change password, search, and test.
Each of these operations, with the exception of suspend, restore, and
change password, are defined in such a manner as to support the
provisioning of any object supported on the resource, but typically
provisioning systems today only focus on provisioning users. Because
of the initial focus on user provisioning, the suspend, restore, and
change password operations are key user-focused operations that
provide convenience.</P>
<P>When performing these eight provisioning
operations, some resources will require either asynchronous or
synchronous communications. The Provisioning Connector API supports
both modes of operation, but the custom connector implementation will
be responsible for performing the communication with the resource
itself.</P>

<b>Figure 1: Provisioning Platform to Connector</b>
</div>
<P>The API consists of a set of java classes that
provide the signatures that a connector must meet to be successfully
integrated with a provisioning platform. These classes are focused on
the interactions needed to communicate between the connector and the
platform for the execution and confirmation of provisioning actions.
These classes are designed to loosely couple the connector with the
provisioning platform for possible portability between platforms.
When implementing these actions, however, the use of additional
platform specific API’s may become more valuable to provide a
complete solution than the need of portability. For making use of the
additional services provided by the Identity Manager provisioning
platform, please reference the <A HREF="../../api/index.html">Identity
Manager provisioning API reference documentation</A>.</P>
<H2><A NAME="apiDescription"></A>API Description</H2>
<P>The Provisioning Connector API consists of a set
of classes that define the interface between the provisioning
platform and the provisioning connector. All of these classes can be
found in the <A HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/remoteservices/provider/package-summary.html">com.ibm.itim.remoteservices.provider</A>
and <A HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/remoteservices/exception/package-summary.html">com.ibm.itim.remoteservices.exception</A>
packages. The <A HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/common/package-summary.html">com.ibm.itim.common
package</A> is also referenced for its definition of classes to
represent attributes.</P>
<P>The focal class in the API is the
<A HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/remoteservices/provider/ServiceProvider.html">ServiceProvider</A>.
The ServiceProvider holds the interface for the eight standard
operations, and for all intent and purposes, represents the connector
to the provisioning platform. Most of these operation interfaces can
support both synchronous and asynchronous calls. 
</P>
<P>The choice of whether to operate synchronously
or asynchronously is determined by the ServiceProvider
implementation. The platform is made aware of this behavior by
passing back a pending status (see the <A HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/remoteservices/provider/RequestStatus.html">RequestStatus</A>
class) at the time of the call. The ServiceProvider will then inform
the platform of the completion of the operation by using a <A HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/remoteservices/provider/Notifier.html">Notifier</A>.
The Notifier is just one interface that can be used to communicate
directly from the connector to the provisioning platform. The
Notifier, and other platform interfaces, can be retrieved by using
the <A HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/remoteservices/provider/InitialPlatformContext.html">InitialPlatformContext</A>
class.</P>
<P>The InitialPlatformContext provides
ServiceProvider implementations an interface to obtain provisioning
platform specific services in a platform independent manner. This
will help enable portability between provisioning platforms. Besides
the Notifier already mentioned, a DirContext instance can be obtained
from the InitialPlatformContext which can be used by the connector to
store and retrieve information in the provisioning platform’s
directory (note: The term directory usually implies an LDAP directory
to most people, but a given platform may implement the directory
interface with any backend data store). Please see the Java
Development Kit v1.3.1 API documentation for a more detailed
description of the DirContext.</P>
<P>In addition to the InitialPlatformContext, when
building a connector that is tailored for the Identity Manager
provisioning platform, all other API’s listed in the <A HREF="../../api/index.html">Identity
Manager API documentation</A> may be used. These API’s may help a
connector implementation to better integrate its capabilities with
Identity Manager’s other services.</P>
<P>One of the prime functions of a connector is to
provide the provisioning platform the ability to retrieve information
from the managed resource or service. A search interface is provided
by ServiceProvider to do this. The interface takes a <A HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/remoteservices/provider/SearchCriteria.html">SearchCriteria</A>
to direct the ServiceProvider as to what information the platform
needs. This SearchCriteria will contain an LDAP search filter in RFC
2256 format and a search base to identify which entries should be
returned. The matching results are returned in a <A HREF="../../api/com/ibm/itim/remoteservices/provider/SearchResults.html">SearchResults</A>
object, which is implemented as part of the ServiceProvider
implementation. The ability to cancel a currently executing search is
provided through the SearchResults interface. By defining only an
interface for SearchResults, a connector implementation can provide
for lazy retrieval and abort capabilities in a resource specific
manner, if available.</P>
<P>Due to the diverse capabilities of some
resources and services, some operations may not be supportable by
some connectors. In situations where an operation cannot be
implemented, the expected behavior of the ServiceProvider is to throw
an UnsupportedOperationException. This exception can be
found in the Java Development Kit v1.3.1 API documentation.</P>
<H2><A NAME="apiExample"></A>API Example</H2>
<P>Please see the accompanying example code with
this package.</P>
<H2><a name="connectorReg"></a>Connector Registration</H2>
<P>To completely integrate the connector with the
provisioning platform, that connector must somehow be registered with
the platform so it knows when to invoke it. The integrate a connector
with Identity Manager, the integration process has three main steps,
register ServiceProvider implementation with the application server,
define and register an LDAP schema to represent services and users
associated with the connector, and define the behavioral properties
of the connector.</P>
<P>To register the ServiceProvider implementation
with the application server, all java classes that have been
developed in the implementation must be placed in the application
server’s classpath. Modifying the application server environment shared library for Identity Manager Lib can accomplish this.</P>
<P>In the Identity Manager platform, the resource
or service that needs to be provisioned must first be instantiated
and configured so that the platform can pass along resource instance
specific properties to the connector to implement the provisioning
operations. When users are provisioned on to this “service”, the
user’s settings are represented as a user account object within the
platform. For the platform to store and display the correct set of
parameters for both the service and the user account instances, a
proper LDAP schema must be defined for them. So, for example, to
provision an NT domain server with a DAML based connector, an NT
domain service class is defined in LDAP to hold the DAML protocol
parameters and the domain name to be provisioned. Another LDAP class
is defined to hold the NT user account information, such as groups
and password. In addition to these base set of classes, any other
information that can be retrieved from the connector, such as the
existing groups on the NT domain server, must have a defined schema
as well, so that Identity Manager can store them in its local
directory once retrieved. 
</P>
<P>The final step in the registration process is to
create and install a resource definition. This definition is an XML
file that specifies the relationships between the connector and the
schema classes defined, along with behavioral properties that are
common to all instances of the connector. The behavioral properties
can be properties that the platform uses to configure or communicate
with the connector, such as the ServiceProviderFactory class name.
They can also be properties that are used within the connector
implementation and may be connector specific. The DTD for this file
is listed in Appendix A. The platform behavioral properties that can
be used are listed below.</P>
<P>The resource definition file should be named
resource.def. That file, along with the DSML schema file, should be
placed in a file directory with the same name as the service profile
name (see the resource definition DTD) under the remoteservices file
directory in the Identity Manager distribution. With this done, the
config_remote_services script provided in the distribution can be run
to register the information with the Identity Manager platform and
the directory server.</P>
<p>For the newer ISDI based adapters the resource definition file is named service.def, and the prefered method to register the resource definition is to make a jar file of the directory that contains all of the resource definition files, and use the Identity Manager UI Configure System &gt; Manage Service Types to import the jar file.</p>
<H2><a name="appendixA"></a>Appendix A – Resource Definition</H2>
<P>This appendix lists the resource definition DTD
and the Identity Manager platform specific properties that can be
used to instruct Identity Manager on how to interact with the
connector. The DTD can also be found in the resource.dtd file.</P>
